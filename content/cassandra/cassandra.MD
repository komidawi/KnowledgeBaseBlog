# Theory

1. Cassandra Strengths
   1. **Scalability**
      - Linear scale performance
   2. **Reliability**
      - No single point of failure  
        (Peer-to-Peer leaderless architecture)
   3. **Availability**
2. Cassandra characteristics
   - IDs are created in an independent manner using UUIDs  
     (Also for time ordered data you can use TIMEUUID)

# Keyspaces

1. Keyspaces
   - Keyspaces are similar to relational "schemas"
   - Serve as a namespace (or wrapper) around DB objects
2. Create Keyspace
   - When creating Keyspace you must provide replication parameters
   - `CREATE KEYSPACE <keyspace> WITH REPLICATION = { 'class': '<replication>', 'replication_factor': <replication_factor> }`
     - e.g. `CREATE KEYSPACE killrvideo WITH REPLICATION = { 'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1 }`
3. Set Keyspace
   - `USE <keyspace>;`
4. Show Keyspaces
   - `DESCRIBE KEYSPACES;`
   - `SELECT * FROM system_schema.keyspaces;`

# Tables

1. Create table
   - ```sql
        CREATE TABLE videos (
            video_id TIMEUUID,
            added_date TIMESTAMP,
            title TEXT,
            PRIMARY KEY (video_id)
        );
     ```
2. Insert data
   - `INSERT INTO videos (video_id, added_date, title) VALUES (1645ea59-14bd-11e5-a993-8138354b7e31, '2014-01-29', 'Cassandra History');`
3. Insert data from file
   - `COPY videos (video_id, added_date, title) FROM 'videos.csv' WITH HEADER = TRUE;`
4. Show info about table
   - `DESCRIBE TABLE my_table;`
5. Remove everything
   - `TRUNCATE videos`

# Partitions

1. Partition Key
   - It makes data grouped together
   - It's responsible for how the data is placed on the Ring
     - So basing on Partition Key you know where data is located on the Ring
   - It's a part of `PRIMARY KEY`
   - Partitioner uses consistent hashing algorithm
     - Querying for data is O(1)
2. `PRIMARY KEY`
   - The first value in `PRIMARY KEY` is always Partition Key
   - To make `PRIMARY KEY` unique, additional ID is added (like ordinal ID or UUID)
   - You can't change `PRIMARY KEY` in existing data model
     - There's no `ALTER TABLE` and add column to `PRIMARY KEY`
3. Clustering Columns
   - The first column in `PRIMARY KEY` is Partition Key, remaining ones are Clustering Columns
     - `PRIMARY KEY((state), city, name, manual_unique_id)`
   - Data is **sorted** according to these Clustering Columns
     - And it's sorted during the **insert**
   - You can inverse sorting using `PRIMARY KEY (...) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (city DESC, name ASC)`
     - ðŸ”¨ Descending sorting can be helpful for Time Series data, as we're gonna have the latest data right on the top
4. Querying
   - **Always provide a Partition Key** - you ought to use it for the system to know where data lies.  
     Otherwise you'd end up with a full scan.
   - You can use `=`, `<`, `>` on Clustering Columns
   - **All equality comparisons must come before inequality operators**
   - Specify comparisons in exact order as in the `PRIMARY KEY`
   - As data is sorted on disk, range searches are a binary search followed by a linear read
5. `ALLOW FILTERING`
   - Makes Cassandra scan all partitions in the table
   - **Don't use it**
     - Unless you really, really have to do it
     - Avoid larger data sets
     - But still, pls, don't use it
   - **If you need such a query, there's probably something wrong with your data model**

# Cassandra

1. Start Cassandra
   - Use `cassandra` to start

# Nodetool

1. Check status
   - `nodetool status`
