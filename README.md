## Install

- Node
    - \[Linux] `nvm` is fine
    - \[Windows] `nvm-for-windows` is fine
- Ruby + Jekyll
    - \[Linux] `rbenv` is fine
    - \[Windows] don't use `rbenv-for-windows` - it's bugged
        - Use RubyInstaller - see [Official Jekyll Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/)

## Run

- `bundle exec jekyll start`
    - or shorter: `bundle exec jekyll s`

Remember to add `bundle exec` before all `jekyll` commands ([docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/)).
