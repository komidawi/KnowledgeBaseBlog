## Problem

Today, all of a sudden, my `git push` stopped working.  
Such an error was occurring with every attempt:

```
remote:
remote: ========================================================================
remote:
remote: The namespace you were looking for could not be found.
remote:
remote: ========================================================================
remote:
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

It was strange, as I didn't change anything neither in git config, nor in any other configurations.

After executing `ssh -T git@{gitlab-url}` I was receiving the proper response of `Welcome to GitLab, @username!`

I could also make `git pull` and everything worked.

The one thing I couldn't do was `git push` (or here: `git push -u origin branch-name`)

Elementary troubleshooting like checking VPN, restarting IntelliJ, using different terminal(s), restarting PC didn't help, neither StackOverflow solutions.

## Solution

I made a new `git clone` of repository and compared `.git/config` file.  
There was one notable difference:  
(Note: `{variables}` was redacted, replace them with your ones)

```bash
[remote "origin"]
	url = git@{gitlab-url}:{namespace}/{repository-name}.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
```
{: file="new/.git/.config" }

```bash
[remote "origin"]
	url = git@{gitlab-url}:{username}/{namespace}/{repository-name}.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	pushurl = git@{gitlab-url}:{username}/{namespace}/{repository-name}.gitgitlab-ci-token:@git@{gitlab-url}:{namespace}/{repository-name}.git
```
{: file="old/.git/.config" }

I don't know how this `pushurl` was set, probably due some refactoring etc.  
Nevertheless, it was the culprit.

To fix this I just replaced contents of `[remote "origin"]` in old file using the ones copied from the new file - and that's all.
