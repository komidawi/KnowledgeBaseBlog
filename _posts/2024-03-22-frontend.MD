## HTML

### Theory

1. HTML markup goal is to provide semantic information about content (not presentational).  
   It should be used to define structure of document and leave appearance for CSS.
    1. Pseudo-obsolete elements as `<b>` and `<i>` are examples of this case.  
       They started as **bold** and _italics_, but in HTML5 to create separation between structure and presentation `<strong>` and `<em>` was introduced.
2. HTML merges all whitespaces into a single space.
    1. Also don't abuse `<br/>` tag.  
       Remember - HTML is for semantic information, not for positioning elements. Don't use it for adding multiple empty lines between paragraphs.
    2. Similar case is for `<hr/>` - don't use it for displaying line.  
       For such purpose use CSS border property instead. 1. Also for `<hr/>` element think as it is something of importance between new paragraph and new heading.
3. **Attributes**
    1. In `<a href="...">...</a>`, the `href` is an Attribute
    2. Attributes provide additional information about elements
    3. Attributes are always specified in the start tag
    4. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
4. Block-level elements (flow content)
    - Block-level elements are always drawn on a new line
5. Inline elements (phrasing content)
    - Inline elements are able to affect sections of text anywhere within a line
6. Links
    1. **Absolute Links**
        1. Example
            1. `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/html`
        2. Build
            1. Scheme
                1. `https://`
            2. Domain
                1. `developer.mozilla.org`
            3. Path
                1. `/en-us/docs/web/html`
    2. **Relative links**
        1. Relative links point relatively as you were in terminal.
           Scheme and domain name are implied to be the same as the current page, so you only supply the path.
            1. `misc/extras.html`
            2. `../images.html`
    3. **Root-Relative Links**
        1. `/index.html`
7. Don't use spaces in URLs
    1. They require special handling, they should be avoided at all costs.
    2. Instead of space use hyphen
    3. Also it's good idea to use all lowercase characters for consistency
8. Images
    - Unlike all the HTML elements weâ€™ve encountered so far, image content is defined outside of the web page that renders it.

### Relevant tags

1.  `<header>`
    -   Introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements or others like a logo, a search form, an author name.
2.  `<main>`
    -   Dominant content of the `<body>` of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to (or expands upon) the central topic of a document (or the central functionality of an application).
    1. `<aside>`
        - Portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.
    2. `<section>`
        - Generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.
3.  `<a>`
    1. `target="_blank"`
        - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab

## CSS

### Model

On the left side there's a definition and on the right side an example of it:

Value: `20px`

Property: `font-size`

Declaration (Style): `font-size: 20px`

Declaration block:

```css
 {
  color: blue;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

Selector: `h1`

CSS Rule:

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

### Box model

Box model consists of 4 elements.

1. content
2. padding
3. border
4. margin
